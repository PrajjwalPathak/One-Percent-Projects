It lacks the following important features −\', \'Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has been kept for security reason.\', \'JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no such support available.\', \'The specification for JavaScript 2.0 can be found on the following site: http://www.ecmascript.org/\']','[\'JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.\', \'JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.\', \'Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.\', \'It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include programs that interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content.\', \'The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI server-side scripts. For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field.\', \'The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the entries are valid, they would be submitted to the Web Server.\', \'JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly.\', \'Less server interaction − You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.\', \"Immediate feedback to the visitors − They don\'t have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.\", \'Increased interactivity − You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.\', \'Richer interfaces − You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.\', \'Once again, JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language that allows you to build interactivity into otherwise static HTML pages.\', \"One of major strengths of JavaScript is that it does not require expensive development tools. You can start with a simple text editor such as Notepad. Since it is an interpreted language inside the context of a web browser, you don\'t even need to buy a compiler.\", \'To make our life simpler, various vendors have come up with very nice JavaScript editing tools. Some of them are listed here −\', \'Microsoft FrontPage − Microsoft has developed a popular HTML editor called FrontPage. FrontPage also provides web developers with a number of JavaScript tools to assist in the creation of interactive websites.\', \'Macromedia Dreamweaver MX − Macromedia Dreamweaver MX is a very popular HTML and JavaScript editor in the professional web development crowd. It provides several handy prebuilt JavaScript components, integrates well with databases, and conforms to new standards such as XHTML and XML.\', \'Macromedia HomeSite 5 − HomeSite 5 is a well-liked HTML and JavaScript editor from Macromedia that can be used to manage personal websites effectively.\', \'The ECMAScript Edition 5 standard will be the first update to be released in over four years. JavaScript 2.0 conforms to Edition 5 of the ECMAScript standard, and the difference between the two is extremely minor.\', \"Today, Netscape\'s JavaScript and Microsoft\'s JScript conform to the ECMAScript standard, although both the languages still support the features that are not a part of the standard.\"]','[]','[]','[]','[\"JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.|||Designed for creating network-centric applications.|||Complementary to and integrated with Java.|||Complementary to and integrated with HTML.|||Open and cross-platform|||Less server interaction − You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server.

For example, Name and name are two different variables.\']','[\'One of the most fundamental characteristics of a programming language is the set of data types it supports. These are the type of values that can be represented and manipulated in a programming language.\', \'JavaScript also defines two trivial data types, null and undefined, each of which defines only a single value. In addition to these primitive data types, JavaScript supports a composite data type known as object. We will cover objects in detail in a separate chapter.\', \'Note − JavaScript does not make a distinction between integer values and floating-point values. All numbers in JavaScript are represented as floating-point values. JavaScript represents numbers using the 64-bit floating-point format defined by the IEEE 754 standard.\', \'Like many other programming languages, JavaScript has variables. Variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.\', \'Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are declared with the var keyword as follows.\', \'Storing a value in a variable is called variable initialization. You can do variable initialization at the time of variable creation or at a later point in time when you need that variable.\', \'For instance, you might create a variable named money and assign the value 2000.50 to it later. For another variable, you can assign a value at the time of initialization as follows.\', \'Note − Use the var keyword only for declaration or initialization, once for the life of any variable name in a document. You should not re-declare same variable twice.\', \"JavaScript is untyped language. This means that a JavaScript variable can hold a value of any data type. Unlike many other languages, you don\'t have to tell JavaScript during variable declaration what type of value the variable will hold. The value type of a variable can change during the execution of a program and JavaScript takes care of it automatically.\", \'The scope of a variable is the region of your program in which it is defined. JavaScript variables have only two scopes.\', \'Local Variables − A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.\', \'Within the body of a function, a local variable takes precedence over a global variable with the same name. If you declare a local variable or function parameter with the same name as a global variable, you effectively hide the global variable. Take a look into the following example.\', \'You should not use any of the JavaScript reserved keywords as a variable name. These keywords are mentioned in the next section. For example, break or boolean variable names are not valid.\', \'JavaScript variable names should not start with a numeral (0-9). They must begin with a letter or an underscore character. For example, 123test is an invalid variable name but _123test is a valid one.\', \'A list of all the reserved words in JavaScript are given in the following table.

There may also be a situation when you want to skip a part of your code block and start the next iteration of the loop.\', \'To handle all such situations, JavaScript provides break and continue statements. These statements are used to immediately come out of any loop or to start the next iteration of any loop respectively.\', \'The break statement, which was briefly introduced with the switch statement, is used to exit a loop early, breaking out of the enclosing curly braces.\', \'The following example illustrates the use of a break statement with a while loop. Notice how the loop breaks out early once x reaches 5 and reaches to document.write (..) statement just below to the closing curly brace −\', \'The continue statement tells the interpreter to immediately start the next iteration of the loop and skip the remaining code block.

It helps programmers in writing modular codes. Functions allow a programmer to divide a big program into a number of small and manageable functions.\', \'Like any other advanced programming language, JavaScript also supports all the features necessary to write modular code using functions. You must have seen functions like alert() and write() in the earlier chapters. We were using these functions again and again, but they had been written in core JavaScript only once.\', \'JavaScript allows us to write our own functions as well. This section explains how to write your own functions in JavaScript.\', \'Before we use a function, we need to define it. The most common way to define a function in JavaScript is by using the function keyword, followed by a unique function name, a list of parameters (that might be empty), and a statement block surrounded by curly braces.\', \'To invoke a function somewhere later in the script, you would simply need to write the name of that function as shown in the following code.\', \'Till now, we have seen functions without parameters. But there is a facility to pass different parameters while calling a function. These passed parameters can be captured inside the function and any manipulation can be done over those parameters. A function can take multiple parameters separated by comma.\', \'A JavaScript function can have an optional return statement. This is required if you want to return a value from a function. This statement should be the last statement in a function.\', \'For example, you can pass two numbers in a function and then you can expect the function to return their multiplication in your calling program.\', \'Try the following example. It defines a function that takes two parameters and concatenates them before returning the resultant in the calling program.\', \'There is a lot to learn about JavaScript functions, however we have covered the most important concepts in this tutorial.\']','[\'\n<script type = \"text/javascript\">\n   <!--\n      function functionname(parameter-list) {\n         statements\n      }\n   //-->\n</script>\n\', \'\n<script type = \"text/javascript\">\n   <!--\n      function sayHello() {\n         alert(\"Hello there\");\n      }\n   //-->\n</script>\n\', \'\n<html>\n   <head>   \n      <script type = \"text/javascript\">\n         function sayHello() {\n            document.write (\"Hello there!\");\n         }\n      </script>\n      \n   </head>\n   \n   <body>\n      <p>Click the following button to call the function</p>      \n      <form>\n         <input type = \"button\" onclick = \"sayHello()\" value = \"Say Hello\">\n      </form>      \n      <p>Use different text in write method and then try...</p>\n   </body>\n</html>\n\', \'\n<html>\n   <head>   \n      <script type = \"text/javascript\">\n         function sayHello(name, age) {\n            document.write (name + \" is \" + age + \" years old.\");\n         }\n      </script>      \n   </head>\n   \n   <body>\n      <p>Click the following button to call the function</p>      \n      <form>\n         <input type = \"button\" onclick = \"sayHello(\'Zara\', 7)\" value = \"Say Hello\">\n      </form>      \n      <p>Use different parameters inside the function and then try...</p>\n   </body>\n</html>\n\', \'\n<html>\n   <head>  \n      <script type = \"text/javascript\">\n         function concatenate(first, last) {\n            var full;\n            full = first + last;\n            return full;\n         }\n         function secondFunction() {\n            var result;\n            result = concatenate(\'Zara\', \'Ali\');\n            document.write (result );\n         }\n      </script>      \n   </head>\n   \n   <body>\n      <p>Click the following button to call the function</p>      \n      <form>\n         <input type = \"button\" onclick = \"secondFunction()\" value = \"Call Function\">\n      </form>      \n      <p>Use different parameters inside the function and then try...</p>  \n  </body>\n</html>\n\']','[\'\n<script type = \"text/javascript\">\n   <!--\n      function functionname(parameter-list) {\n         statements\n      }\n   //-->\n</script>\n\']','[]','[\'JavaScript Nested Functions|||JavaScript  Function( ) Constructor|||JavaScript Function Literals|||\']'),(14,'[\'JavaScript -

If validate() function returns true, the form will be submitted, otherwise it will not submit the data.\', \'These two event types will help you create nice effects with images or even with text as well. The onmouseover event triggers when you bring your mouse over any element and the onmouseout triggers when you move your mouse out from that element.

A programming language can be called object-oriented if it provides four basic capabilities to developers −\', \'Inheritance − the capability of a class to rely upon another class (or number of classes) for some of its properties and methods.\', \'Objects are composed of attributes. If an attribute contains a function, it is considered to be a method of the object, otherwise the attribute is considered a property.\', \"Object properties can be any of the three primitive data types, or any of the abstract data types, such as another object. Object properties are usually variables that are used internally in the object\'s methods, but can also be globally visible variables that are used throughout the page.\", \'Methods are the functions that let the object do something or let something be done to it. There is a small difference between a function and a method – at a function is a standalone unit of statements and a method is attached to an object and can be referenced by the this keyword.\', \'Methods are useful for everything from displaying the contents of the object to the screen to performing complex mathematical operations on a group of local properties and parameters.\', \'For example − Following is a simple example to show how to use the write() method of document object to write any content on the document.\', \'The new operator is used to create an instance of an object. To create an object, the new operator is followed by the constructor method.\', \'In the following example, the constructor methods are Object(), Array(), and Date(). These constructors are built-in JavaScript functions.\', \'A constructor is a function that creates and initializes an object. JavaScript provides a special constructor function called Object() to build the object. The return value of the Object() constructor is assigned to a variable.\', \'The variable contains a reference to the new object. The properties assigned to the object are not variables and are not defined with the var keyword.\', \'This example demonstrates how to create an object with a User-Defined Function. Here this keyword is used to refer to the object that has been passed to a function.\', \'The previous examples demonstrate how the constructor creates the object and assigns properties.

Here is a simple form in html format.\', \'Now we will see how we can validate our entered form data before submitting it to the web server.\']','[\'Form validation normally used to occur at the server, after the client had entered all the necessary data and then pressed the Submit button. If the data entered by a client was incorrect or was simply missing, the server would have to send all the data back to the client and request that the form be resubmitted with correct information. This was really a lengthy process which used to put a lot of burden on the server.\', \"JavaScript provides a way to validate form\'s data on the client\'s computer before sending it to the web server. Form validation generally performs two functions.\", \'Basic Validation − First of all, the form must be checked to make sure all the mandatory fields are filled in. It would require just a loop through each field in the form and check for data.\', \'Data Format Validation − Secondly, the data that is entered must be checked for correct form and value. Your code must include appropriate logic to test correctness of data.\', \'First let us see how to do a basic form validation. In the above form, we are calling validate() to validate data when onsubmit event is occurring. The following code shows the implementation of this validate() function.\', \'The following example shows how to validate an entered email address. An email address must contain at least a ‘@’ sign and a dot (.).

You should not used a single = for comparison purpose.\', \'Declare variables explicitly using the var keyword.\']','[\'Double-clicking this icon takes you to a dialog box showing information about the specific error that occurred.\', \'Use descriptive variable and function names and avoid using single-character names.\']','[\'Every now and then, developers commit mistakes while coding. A mistake in a program or a script is referred to as a bug.\', \'The process of finding and fixing bugs is called debugging and is a normal part of the development process. This section covers tools and techniques that can help you with debugging tasks..\', \'The most basic way to track down errors is by turning on error information in your browser. By default, Internet Explorer shows an error icon in the status bar when an error occurs on the page.\', \'Since this icon is easy to overlook, Internet Explorer gives you the option to automatically show the Error dialog box whenever an error occurs.\', \'To enable this option, select Tools → Internet Options → Advanced tab. and then finally check the \"Display a Notification About Every Script Error\" box option as shown below −\', \'Other browsers like Firefox, Netscape, and Mozilla send error messages to a special window called the JavaScript Console or Error Consol. To view the console, select Tools → Error Consol or Web Development.\', \'Unfortunately, since these browsers give no visual indication when an error occurs, you must keep the Console open and watch for errors as your script executes.\', \'Error notifications that show up on Console or through Internet Explorer dialog boxes are the result of both syntax and runtime errors. These error notification include the line number at which the error occurred.\', \'If you are using Firefox, then you can click on the error available in the error console to go to the exact line in the script having error.\', \'One way to check your JavaScript code for strange bugs is to run it through a program that checks it to make sure it is valid and that it follows the official syntax rules of the language. These programs are called validating parsers or just validators for short, and often come with commercial HTML and JavaScript editors.\', \"The most convenient validator for JavaScript is Douglas Crockford\'s JavaScript Lint, which is available for free at Douglas Crockford\'s JavaScript Lint.\", \'Simply visit that web page, paste your JavaScript (Only JavaScript) code into the text area provided, and click the jslint button. This program will parse through your JavaScript code, ensuring that all the variable and function definitions follow the correct syntax. It will also check JavaScript statements, such as if and while, to ensure they too follow the correct format\', \'You can use the alert() or document.write() methods in your program to debug your code. For example, you might write something as follows −\', \'By examining the content and order of the alert() as they appear, you can examine the health of your program very easily.\', \'A debugger is an application that places all aspects of script execution under the control of the programmer. Debuggers provide fine-grained control over the state of the script through an interface that allows you to examine and set values as well as control the flow of execution.\', \'Once a script has been loaded into a debugger, it can be run one line at a time or instructed to halt at certain breakpoints. Once execution is halted, the programmer can examine the state of the script and its variables in order to determine if something is amiss. You can also watch variables for changes in their values.\', \'The latest version of the Mozilla JavaScript Debugger (code-named Venkman) for both Mozilla and Netscape browsers can be downloaded at http://www.hacksrus.com/~ginda/venkman\', \'You can keep the following tips in mind to reduce the number of errors in your scripts and simplify the debugging process −\', \'Use plenty of comments. Comments enable you to explain why you wrote the script the way you did and to explain particularly difficult sections of code.\', \'Always use indentation to make your code easy to read. Indenting statements also makes it easier for you to match up beginning and ending tags, curly braces, and other HTML and script elements.\', \'Write modular code. Whenever possible, group your statements into functions. Functions let you group related statements, and test and reuse portions of code with minimal effort.\', \'Be consistent in the way you name your variables and functions. Try using names that are long enough to be meaningful and that describe the contents of the variable or the purpose of the function.\', \'Use consistent syntax when naming variables and functions. In other words, keep them all lowercase or all uppercase; if you prefer Camel-Back notation, use it consistently.\', \'Test long scripts in a modular fashion. In other words, do not try to write the entire script before testing any portion of it. Write a piece and get it to work before adding the next portion of code.\', \'Watch your quotation marks. Remember that quotation marks are used in pairs around strings and that both quotation marks must be of the same style (either single or double).\']','[\'\nvar debugging = true;\nvar whichImage = \"widget\";\n\nif( debugging )\n   alert( \"Calls swapImage() with argument: \" + whichImage );\n   var swapStatus = swapImage( whichImage );\n\nif( debugging )\n   alert( \"Exits swapImage() with swapStatus=\" + swapStatus );\n\']','[]','[]','[\'Use plenty of comments.
