This means that a reference to the variable is manipulated by the function rather than a copy of the variable\'s value.\", \'Any changes made to an argument in these cases will change the value of the original variable.

Many things can go wrong in your program that cause the PHP interpreter to generate an error message. You have a choice about where those error messages go. The messages can be sent along with other program output to the web browser. They can also be included in the web server error log.\', \'To make error messages display in the browser, set the display_errors configuration directive to On. To send errors to the web server error log, set log_errors to On. You can set them both to On if you want error messages in both places.\', \'PHP defines some constants you can use to set the value of error_reporting such that only errors of certain types get reported: E_ALL (for all errors except strict notices), E_PARSE (parse errors), E_ERROR (fatal errors), E_WARNING (warnings), E_NOTICE (notices), and E_STRICT (strict notices).\', \'While writing your PHP program, it is a good idea to use PHP-aware editors like BBEdit or Emacs. One of the special special features of these  editors is syntax highlighting. It changes the color of different parts of your program based on what those parts are. For example, strings are pink, keywords such as if and while are blue, comments are grey, and variables are black.\', \'Another feature is quote and bracket matching, which helps to make sure that your quotes and brackets are balanced. When you type a closing delimiter such as }, the editor highlights the opening { that it matches.\', \"Missing Semicolons − Every PHP statement ends with a semicolon (;).

Remember: To PHP, $test is not the same variable as $Test.\', \'Missing Dollar Signs − A missing dollar sign in a variable name is really hard to see, but at least it usually results in an error message so that you know where to look for the problem.\', \'Troubling Quotes − You can have too many, too few, or the wrong kind of quotes.

− These are the function defined inside a class and are used to access object data.\', \'Parent class − A class that is inherited from by another class. This is also called a base class or super class.\', \'Child Class − A class that inherits from another class. This is also called a subclass or derived class.\', \'Data Abstraction − Any representation of data in which the implementation details are hidden (abstracted).\', \'Encapsulation − refers to a concept where we encapsulate all the data and member functions together to form an object.\', \'The special form class, followed by the name of the class that you want to define.\', \'A set of braces enclosing any number of variable declarations and function definitions.\', \'The variable $this is a special variable and it refers to the same object ie. itself.\', \'Following example shows how to set title and prices for the three books by calling member functions.\', \'Now you call another member functions to get the values set by in above example −\', \'The effect of inheritance is that the child class (or subclass or derived class) has the following characteristics −\', \'Following example inherit Books class and adds more functionality based on the requirement.\', \'Now apart from inherited functions, class Novel keeps two additional member functions.\', \'In the following example getPrice and getTitle functions are overridden to return some values.\', \'A class member can be made private by using private keyword infront of the member.\', \'Following example results in Fatal error: Cannot override final method BaseClass::moreTesting()\', \'NOTE − A constructor can be defined with the same name as the name of a class. It is defined in above example.\']','[\'We can imagine our universe made of different objects like sun, earth, moon etc. Similarly we can imagine our car made of different objects like wheel, steering, gear etc. Same way there is object oriented programming concepts which assume everything as an object and implement a software using different objects.\', \'Class − This is a programmer-defined data type, which includes local functions as well as local data. You can think of a class as a template for making many instances of the same kind (or class) of object.\', \'Object − An individual instance of the data structure defined by a class. You define a class once and then make many objects that belong to it. Objects are also known as instance.\', \'Member Variable − These are the variables defined inside a class. This data will be invisible to the outside of the class and can be accessed via member functions. These variables are called attribute of the object once an object is created.\', \'Inheritance − When a class is defined by inheriting existing function of a parent class then it is called inheritance. Here child class will inherit all or few member functions and variables of a parent class.\', \'Polymorphism − This is an object oriented concept where same function can be used for different purposes. For example function name will remain same but it take different number of arguments and can do different task.\', \'Overloading − a type of polymorphism in which some or all of operators have different implementations depending on the types of their arguments. Similarly functions can also be overloaded with different implementation.\', \'Constructor − refers to a special type of function which will be called automatically whenever there is an object formation from a class.\', \'Destructor − refers to a special type of function which will be called automatically whenever an object is deleted or goes out of scope.\', \'Variable declarations start with the special form var, which is followed by a conventional $ variable name; they may also have an initial assignment to a constant value.\', \'Function definitions look much like standalone PHP functions but are local to the class and will be used to set and access object data.\', \'Once you defined your class, then you can create as many objects as you like of that class type. Following is an example of how to create object using new operator.\', \'Here we have created three objects and these objects are independent of each other and they will have their existence separately. Next we will see how to access member function and process member variables.\', \'After creating your objects, you will be able to call member functions related to that object. One member function will be able to process member variable of related object only.\', \'Constructor Functions are special type of functions which are called automatically whenever an object is created. So we take full advantage of this behaviour, by initializing many things through constructor functions. \', \'PHP provides a special function called __construct() to define a constructor. You can pass as many as arguments you like into the constructor function.\', \'Following example will create one constructor for Books class and it will initialize price and title for the book at the time of object creation.\', \"Now we don\'t need to call set function separately to set price and title. We can initialize these two member variables at the time of object creation only. Check following example below −\", \'Like a constructor function you can define a destructor function using function __destruct(). You can release all the resources with-in a destructor.\', \'PHP class definitions can optionally inherit from a parent class definition by using the extends clause. The syntax is as follows −\', \'Automatically has all the same member functions as the parent, which (by default) will work the same way as those functions do in the parent.\', \'Function definitions in child classes override definitions with the same name in parent classes. In a child class, we can modify the definition of a function inherited from parent class.\', \'Unless you specify otherwise, properties and methods of a class are public. That is to say, they may be accessed in three possible situations −\', \'Till now we have seen all members as public members. If you wish to limit the accessibility of the members of a class then you define class members as private or protected.\', \'By designating a member private, you limit its accessibility to the class in which it is declared. The private member cannot be referred to from classes that inherit the class in which it is declared and cannot be accessed from outside the class.\', \'When MyClass class is inherited by another class using extends, myPublicFunction() will be visible, as will $driver. The extending class will not have any awareness of or access to myPrivateFunction and $car, because they are declared private.\', \'A protected property or method is accessible in the class in which it is declared, as well as in classes that extend that class. Protected members are not available outside of those two kinds of classes. A class member can be made protected by using protected keyword in front of the member.\', \'Interfaces are defined to provide a common function names to the implementers. Different implementors can implement those interfaces according to their requirements. You can say, interfaces are skeletons which are implemented by developers.\', \'A constant is somewhat like a variable, in that it holds a value, but is really more like a function because a constant is immutable. Once you declare a constant, it does not change.\', \"In this class, requiredMargin is a constant. It is declared with the keyword const, and under no circumstances can it be changed to anything other than 1.7. Note that the constant\'s name does not have a leading $, as variable names do.\", \'An abstract class is one that cannot be instantiated, only inherited. You declare an abstract class with the keyword abstract, like this −\', \"When inheriting from an abstract class, all methods marked abstract in the parent\'s class declaration must be defined by the child; additionally, these methods must be defined with the same visibility.\", \'Note that function definitions inside an abstract class must also be preceded by the keyword abstract. It is not legal to have abstract function definitions inside a non-abstract class.\', \'Declaring class members or methods as static makes them accessible without needing an instantiation of the class. A member declared as static can not be accessed with an instantiated class object (though a static method can).\', \'PHP 5 introduces the final keyword, which prevents child classes from overriding a method by prefixing the definition with final. If the class itself is being defined final then it cannot be extended.\', \"Instead of writing an entirely new constructor for the subclass, let\'s write it by calling the parent\'s constructor explicitly and then doing whatever is necessary in addition for instantiation of the subclass. Here\'s a simple example −\", \'In this example, we have a parent class (Name), which has a two-argument constructor, and a subclass (NameSub1), which has a three-argument constructor.

You can think of a class as a template for making many instances of the same kind (or class) of object.|||Object − An individual instance of the data structure defined by a class. You define a class once and then make many objects that belong to it. Objects are also known as instance.|||Member Variable − These are the variables defined inside a class. This data will be invisible to the outside of the class and can be accessed via member functions. These variables are called attribute of the object once an object is created.|||Member function − These are the function defined inside a class and are used to access object data.|||Inheritance − When a class is defined by inheriting existing function of a parent class then it is called inheritance. Here child class will inherit all or few member functions and variables of a parent class.|||Parent class − A class that is inherited from by another class. This is also called a base class or super class.|||Child Class − A class that inherits from another class. This is also called a subclass or derived class.|||Polymorphism − This is an object oriented concept where same function can be used for different purposes. For example function name will remain same but it take different number of arguments and can do different task.|||Overloading − a type of polymorphism in which some or all of operators have different implementations depending on the types of their arguments.

The language itself is a lot like C, except with untyped variables, a whole lot of Web-specific libraries built in, and everything hooked up directly to your favorite Web server.\', \'The syntax of statements and function definitions should be familiar, except that variables are always preceded by $, and functions do not require separate prototypes.\', \'Syntax − Broadly speaking, PHP syntax is the same as in C: Code is blank insensitive, statements are terminated with semicolons, function calls have the same structure (my_function(expression1, expression2)), and curly braces ({ and }) make statements into blocks. PHP supports C and C++-style comments (/* */ as well as //), and also Perl and shell-script style (#).\', \'Operators − The assignment operators (=, +=, *=, and so on), the Boolean operators (&&, ||, !), the comparison operators (<,>, <=, >=, ==, !=), and the basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %) all behave in PHP as they do in C.\', \'Control structures − The basic control structures (if, switch, while, for) behave as they do in C, including supporting break and continue. One notable difference is that switch in PHP can accept strings as case identifiers.\', \'Dollar signs − All variables are denoted with a leading $. Variables do not need to be declared in advance of assignment, and they have no intrinsic type.\', \'Types − PHP has only two numerical types: integer (corresponding to a long in C) and double (corresponding to a double in C). Strings are of arbitrary length. There is no separate character type.\', \'Type conversion − Types are not checked at compile time, and type errors do not typically occur at runtime either. Instead, variables and values are automatically converted across types as needed.\', \"Arrays − Arrays have a syntax superficially similar to C\'s array syntax, but they are implemented completely differently. They are actually associative arrays or hashes,  and the index can be either a number or a string. They do not need to be declared or allocated in advance.\", \'No structure type − There is no structure in PHP, partly because the array and object types together make it unnecessary. The elements of a PHP array need not be of a consistent type.\', \'No pointers − There are no pointers available in PHP, although the tapeless variables play a similar role. PHP does support variable references. You can also emulate function pointers to some extent, in that function names can be stored in variables and called by using the variable rather than a literal name.\', \'No prototypes − Functions do not need to be declared before their implementation is defined, as long as the definition can be found somewhere in the current code file or included files.\', \'Memory management − The PHP engine is effectively a garbage-collected environment (reference-counted), and in small scripts there is no need to do any deallocation. You should freely allocate new structures - such as new strings and object instances. IN PHP5, it is possible to define destructor for objects, but there is no free or delete.  Destructor are called when the last reference to an object goes away, before the memory is reclaimed.\', \'Permissiveness − As a general matter, PHP is more forgiving than C (especially in its type system) and so will let you get away with new kinds of mistakes. Unexpected results are more common than errors.\']','[]','[]','[]','[\"Syntax − Broadly speaking, PHP syntax is the same as in C: Code is blank insensitive, statements are terminated with semicolons, function calls have the same structure (my_function(expression1, expression2)), and curly braces ({ and }) make statements into blocks.

If you are used to writing CGI scripts in Perl, the main difference in PHP is that you no longer need to explicitly print large blocks of static HTML using print or heredoc statements and instead can simply write the HTML itself outside of the PHP code block.\', \'No @ or % variables − PHP has one only kind of variable, which starts with a dollar sign ($). Any of the datatypes in the language can be stored in such variables, whether scalar or compound.\', \'Arrays versus hashes − PHP has a single datatype called an array that plays the role of both hashes and arrays/lists in Perl.\', \'Specifying arguments to functions − Function calls in PHP look pretty much like subroutine calls in Perl. Function definitions in PHP, on the other hand, typically require some kind of list of formal arguments as in C or Java which is not the csse in PERL.\', \'Variable scoping in functions − In Perl, the default scope for variables is global. This means that top-level variables are visible inside subroutines. Often, this leads to promiscuous use of globals across functions. In PHP, the scope of variables within function definitions is local by default.\', \'No module system as such − In PHP there is no real distinction between normal code files and code files used as imported libraries.\', \'Break and continue rather than next and last − PHP is more like C langauge and uses break and continue instead of next and last statement.\', \'More kinds of comments − In addition to Perl-style (#) single-line comments, PHP offers C-style multiline comments (/* comment */ ) and Java-style single-line comments (// comment).\', \'Regular expressions − PHP does not have a built-in syntax specific to regular expressions, but has most of the same functionality in its \"Perl-compatible\" regular expression functions.\']','[]','[]','[]','[\'Compiled scripting languages − Both Perl and PHP are scripting languages.This means that  they are not used to produce native standalone executables in advance of execution.|||Syntax − PHP\'s basic syntax is very close to Perl\'s, and both share a lot of syntactic features with C.
