Consider the following example, which prints the address of the variables defined −\', \'A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location.

The general form of a pointer variable declaration is −\', \"Here, type is the pointer\'s base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations −\", \'The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.\', \'There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations −\', \'It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.\', \'The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program −\', \'In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system.
