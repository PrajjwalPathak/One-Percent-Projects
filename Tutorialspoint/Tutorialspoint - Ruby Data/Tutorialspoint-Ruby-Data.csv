The forms that take a Fixnum will raise an IndexError if the value is out of range; the Range form will raise a RangeError, and the Regexp and String forms will silently ignore the assignment.&&&55|||str.split(pattern = $, [limit])|||Divides str into substrings based on a delimiter, returning an array of these substrings.|||If pattern is a String, then its contents are used as the delimiter when splitting str. If pattern is a single space, str is split on whitespace, with leading whitespace and runs of contiguous whitespace characters ignored.|||If pattern is a Regexp, str is divided where the pattern matches. Whenever the pattern matches a zero-length string, str is split into individual characters.|||If pattern is omitted, the value of $; is used. If $; is nil (which is the default), str is split on whitespace as if ` ` were specified.|||If the limit parameter is omitted, trailing null fields are suppressed. If limit is a positive number, at most that number of fields will be returned (if limit is 1, the entire string is returned as the only entry in an array). If negative, there is no limit to the number of fields returned, and trailing null fields are not suppressed.|||&&&56|||str.squeeze([other_str]*)|||Builds a set of characters from the other_str parameter(s) using the procedure described for String#count. Returns a new string where runs of the same character that occur in this set are replaced by a single character. If no arguments are given, all runs of identical characters are replaced by a single character.&&&57|||str.squeeze!([other_str]*)|||Squeezes str in place, returning either str, or nil if no changes were made.&&&58|||str.strip|||Returns a copy of str with leading and trailing whitespace removed.&&&59|||str.strip!|||Removes leading and trailing whitespace from str.

[or] str.next!|||Equivalent to String#succ, but modifies the receiver in place.&&&64|||str.sum(n = 16)|||Returns a basic n-bit checksum of the characters in str, where n is the optional Fixnum parameter, defaulting to 16. The result is simply the sum of the binary value of each character in str modulo 2n - 1. This is not a particularly good checksum.&&&65|||str.swapcase|||Returns a copy of str with uppercase alphabetic characters converted to lowercase and lowercase characters converted to uppercase.&&&66|||str.swapcase!|||Equivalent to String#swapcase, but modifies the receiver in place, returning str, or nil if no changes were made.&&&67|||str.to_f|||>Returns the result of interpreting leading characters in str as a floating-point number. Extraneous characters past the end of a valid number are ignored. If there is not a valid number at the start of str, 0.0 is returned. This method never raises an exception.&&&68|||str.to_i(base = 10)|||Returns the result of interpreting leading characters in str as an integer base (base 2, 8, 10, or 16). Extraneous characters past the end of a valid number are ignored. If there is not a valid number at the start of str, 0 is returned. This method never raises an exception.&&&69|||str.to_s [or] str.to_str|||Returns the receiver.|||&&&70|||str.tr(from_str, to_str)|||Returns a copy of str with the characters in from_str replaced by the corresponding characters in to_str. If to_str is shorter than from_str, it is padded with its last character. Both strings may use the c1.c2 notation to denote ranges of characters, and from_str may start with a ^, which denotes all characters except those listed.|||&&&71|||str.tr!(from_str, to_str)|||Translates str in place, using the same rules as String#tr. Returns str, or nil if no changes were made.|||&&&72|||str.tr_s(from_str, to_str)|||Processes a copy of str as described under String#tr, then removes duplicate characters in regions that were affected by the translation.|||&&&73|||str.tr_s!(from_str, to_str)|||Performs String#tr_s processing on str in place, returning str, or nil if no changes were made.|||&&&74|||str.unpack(format)|||>Decodes str (which may contain binary data) according to the format string, returning an array of each value extracted. The format string consists of a sequence of single-character directives, summarized in Table 18. Each directive may be followed by a number, indicating the number of times to repeat with this directive. An asterisk (*) will use up all remaining elements. The directives sSiIlL may each be followed by an underscore (_) to use the underlying platform\'s native size for the specified type; otherwise, it uses a platform-independent consistent size. Spaces are ignored in the format string.|||&&&75|||str.upcase|||Returns a copy of str with all lowercase letters replaced with their uppercase counterparts. The operation is locale insensitive. Only characters a to z are affected.|||&&&76|||str.upcase!|||Changes the contents of str to uppercase, returning nil if no changes are made.|||&&&77|||str.upto(other_str) { |s| block }|||Iterates through successive values, starting at str and ending at other_str inclusive, passing each value in turn to the block.

For formatting specifications, see sprintf for detail.&&&35|||proc {| x|...}|||proc|||See lamda.&&&36|||putc( c)|||Prints one character to the default output ($defout).&&&37|||puts([ str])|||Prints string to the default output ($defout). If the string doesn\'t end with a newline, a newline is appended to the string.&&&38|||raise(...)|||fail(...)|||Raises an exception. Assumes RuntimeError if no exception class is specified. Calling raise|||without arguments in a rescue clause re-raises the exception. Doing so outside a rescue clause raises a message-less RuntimeError. fail is an obsolete name for raise.&&&39|||rand([ max = 0])|||Generates a pseudo-random number greater than or equal to 0 and less than max. If max is either not specified or is set to 0, a random number is returned as a floating-point number greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1. srand may be used to initialize pseudo-random stream.&&&40|||readline([ rs = $/])|||Equivalent to gets except it raises an EOFError exception on reading EOF.&&&41|||readlines([ rs = $/])|||Returns an array of strings holding either the filenames specified as command-line arguments or the contents of standard input.&&&42|||require( lib)|||Loads the library (including extension libraries) lib when it\'s first called. require will not load the same library more than once.

A three-element array containing arrays of the IO objects for which there were changes in status is returned. nil is returned on timeout.&&&45|||set_trace_func( proc)|||Sets a handler for tracing. proc may be a string or proc object. set_trace_func is used by the debugger and profiler.&&&46|||sleep([ sec])|||Suspends program execution for sec seconds. If sec isn\'t specified, the program is suspended forever.&&&47|||split([ sep[, max]])|||Equivalent to $_.split.&&&48|||sprintf( fmt[, arg...])|||format( fmt[, arg...])|||Returns a string in which arg is formatted according to fmt. Formatting specifications are essentially the same as those for sprintf in the C programming language. Conversion specifiers (% followed by conversion field specifier) in fmt are replaced by formatted string of corresponding argument. A list of conversion filed is given below in next section.&&&49|||srand([ seed])|||Initializes an array of random numbers. If seed isn\'t specified, initialization is performed using the time and other system information for the seed.&&&50|||String( obj)|||Returns obj after converting it to a string using obj.to_s.&&&51|||syscall( sys[, arg...])|||Calls an operating system call function specified by number sys. The numbers and meaning of sys is system-dependant.&&&52|||system( cmd[, arg...])|||Executes cmd as a call to the command line. If multiple arguments are specified, the command is run directly with no shell expansion. Returns true if the return status is 0 (success).&&&53|||sub( x, y)|||sub( x) {...}|||Replaces the first string matching x in $_ with y. If a block is specified, matched strings are replaced with the result of the block. The modified result is assigned to $_.&&&54|||sub!( x, y)|||sub!( x) {...}|||Performs the same replacement as sub, except the string is changed in place.&&&55|||test( test, f1[, f2])|||Performs various file tests specified by the character test. In order to improve readability, you should use File class methods (for example File::readable?) rather than this function. A list of arguments is given below in next section.&&&56|||throw( tag[, value = nil])|||Jumps to the catch function waiting with the symbol or string tag. value is the return value to be used by catch.&&&57|||trace_var( var, cmd)|||trace_var( var) {...}|||Sets tracing for a global variable. The variable name is specified as a symbol. cmd may be a string or Proc object.&&&58|||trap( sig, cmd)|||trap( sig) {...}|||Sets a signal handler. sig may be a string (like SIGUSR1) or an integer. SIG may be omitted from signal name. Signal handler for EXIT signal or signal number 0 is invoked just before process termination.&&&59|||untrace_var( var[, cmd])|||Removes tracing for a global variable. If cmd is specified, only that command is removed.', ""Sr.No.|||Methods & Description&&&1|||n + num|||n - num|||n * num|||n / num|||Performs arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.&&&2|||n % num|||Returns the modulus of n.&&&3|||n ** num|||Exponentiation.&&&4|||n.abs|||Returns the absolute value of n.&&&5|||n.ceil|||Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to n.&&&6|||n.coerce( num)|||Returns an array containing num and n both possibly converted to a type that allows them to be operated on mutually.
