If pattern is a single space, str is split on whitespace, with leading whitespace and runs of contiguous whitespace characters ignored.|||If pattern is a Regexp, str is divided where the pattern matches.

The result is simply the sum of the binary value of each character in str modulo 2n - 1. This is not a particularly good checksum.&&&65|||str.swapcase|||Returns a copy of str with uppercase alphabetic characters converted to lowercase and lowercase characters converted to uppercase.&&&66|||str.swapcase!|||Equivalent to String#swapcase, but modifies the receiver in place, returning str, or nil if no changes were made.&&&67|||str.to_f|||>Returns the result of interpreting leading characters in str as a floating-point number.

Extraneous characters past the end of a valid number are ignored. If there is not a valid number at the start of str, 0 is returned. This method never raises an exception.&&&69|||str.to_s [or] str.to_str|||Returns the receiver.|||&&&70|||str.tr(from_str, to_str)|||Returns a copy of str with the characters in from_str replaced by the corresponding characters in to_str. If to_str is shorter than from_str, it is padded with its last character. Both strings may use the c1.c2 notation to denote ranges of characters, and from_str may start with a ^, which denotes all characters except those listed.|||&&&71|||str.tr!(from_str, to_str)|||Translates str in place, using the same rules as String#tr. Returns str, or nil if no changes were made.|||&&&72|||str.tr_s(from_str, to_str)|||Processes a copy of str as described under String#tr, then removes duplicate characters in regions that were affected by the translation.|||&&&73|||str.tr_s!(from_str, to_str)|||Performs String#tr_s processing on str in place, returning str, or nil if no changes were made.|||&&&74|||str.unpack(format)|||>Decodes str (which may contain binary data) according to the format string, returning an array of each value extracted. The format string consists of a sequence of single-character directives, summarized in Table 18. Each directive may be followed by a number, indicating the number of times to repeat with this directive. An asterisk (*) will use up all remaining elements. The directives sSiIlL may each be followed by an underscore (_) to use the underlying platform\'s native size for the specified type; otherwise, it uses a platform-independent consistent size.

Inheritance allows us to define a class in terms of another class, which makes it easier to create and maintain an application.', 'Inheritance also provides an opportunity to reuse the code functionality and fast implementation time but unfortunately Ruby does not support multiple levels of inheritances but Ruby supports mixins. A mixin is like a specialized implementation of multiple inheritance in which only the interface portion is inherited.', 'When creating a class, instead of writing completely new data members and member functions, the programmer can designate that the new class should inherit the members of an existing class. This existing class is called the base class or superclass, and the new class is referred to as the derived class or sub-class.', 'Ruby also supports the concept of subclassing, i.e., inheritance and following example explains the concept. The syntax for extending a class is simple. Just add a < character and the name of the superclass to your class statement. For example, following define a class BigBox as a subclass of Box −', 'Though you can add new functionality in a derived class, but sometimes you would like to change the behavior of already defined method in a parent class.

If the string doesn\'t end with a newline, a newline is appended to the string.&&&38|||raise(...)|||fail(...)|||Raises an exception. Assumes RuntimeError if no exception class is specified. Calling raise|||without arguments in a rescue clause re-raises the exception. Doing so outside a rescue clause raises a message-less RuntimeError. fail is an obsolete name for raise.&&&39|||rand([ max = 0])|||Generates a pseudo-random number greater than or equal to 0 and less than max. If max is either not specified or is set to 0, a random number is returned as a floating-point number greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1. srand may be used to initialize pseudo-random stream.&&&40|||readline([ rs = $/])|||Equivalent to gets except it raises an EOFError exception on reading EOF.&&&41|||readlines([ rs = $/])|||Returns an array of strings holding either the filenames specified as command-line arguments or the contents of standard input.&&&42|||require( lib)|||Loads the library (including extension libraries) lib when it\'s first called. require will not load the same library more than once.

A three-element array containing arrays of the IO objects for which there were changes in status is returned. nil is returned on timeout.&&&45|||set_trace_func( proc)|||Sets a handler for tracing. proc may be a string or proc object. set_trace_func is used by the debugger and profiler.&&&46|||sleep([ sec])|||Suspends program execution for sec seconds. If sec isn\'t specified, the program is suspended forever.&&&47|||split([ sep[, max]])|||Equivalent to $_.split.&&&48|||sprintf( fmt[, arg...])|||format( fmt[, arg...])|||Returns a string in which arg is formatted according to fmt. Formatting specifications are essentially the same as those for sprintf in the C programming language. Conversion specifiers (% followed by conversion field specifier) in fmt are replaced by formatted string of corresponding argument. A list of conversion filed is given below in next section.&&&49|||srand([ seed])|||Initializes an array of random numbers. If seed isn\'t specified, initialization is performed using the time and other system information for the seed.&&&50|||String( obj)|||Returns obj after converting it to a string using obj.to_s.&&&51|||syscall( sys[, arg...])|||Calls an operating system call function specified by number sys. The numbers and meaning of sys is system-dependant.&&&52|||system( cmd[, arg...])|||Executes cmd as a call to the command line. If multiple arguments are specified, the command is run directly with no shell expansion. Returns true if the return status is 0 (success).&&&53|||sub( x, y)|||sub( x) {...}|||Replaces the first string matching x in $_ with y. If a block is specified, matched strings are replaced with the result of the block. The modified result is assigned to $_.&&&54|||sub!( x, y)|||sub!( x) {...}|||Performs the same replacement as sub, except the string is changed in place.&&&55|||test( test, f1[, f2])|||Performs various file tests specified by the character test. In order to improve readability, you should use File class methods (for example File::readable?) rather than this function. A list of arguments is given below in next section.&&&56|||throw( tag[, value = nil])|||Jumps to the catch function waiting with the symbol or string tag. value is the return value to be used by catch.&&&57|||trace_var( var, cmd)|||trace_var( var) {...}|||Sets tracing for a global variable. The variable name is specified as a symbol. cmd may be a string or Proc object.&&&58|||trap( sig, cmd)|||trap( sig) {...}|||Sets a signal handler. sig may be a string (like SIGUSR1) or an integer. SIG may be omitted from signal name. Signal handler for EXIT signal or signal number 0 is invoked just before process termination.&&&59|||untrace_var( var[, cmd])|||Removes tracing for a global variable. If cmd is specified, only that command is removed.', ""Sr.No.|||Methods & Description&&&1|||n + num|||n - num|||n * num|||n / num|||Performs arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.&&&2|||n % num|||Returns the modulus of n.&&&3|||n ** num|||Exponentiation.&&&4|||n.abs|||Returns the absolute value of n.&&&5|||n.ceil|||Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to n.&&&6|||n.coerce( num)|||Returns an array containing num and n both possibly converted to a type that allows them to be operated on mutually.
