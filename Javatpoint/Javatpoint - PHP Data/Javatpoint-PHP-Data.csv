Below some advantages and uses of regular expressions are given:\n\nRegular expression helps the programmers to validate text string.\nIt offers a powerful tool to analyze and search a pattern as well as to modify the text string.\nBy using regexes functions, simple and easy solutions are provided to identify the patterns. \nRegexes are helpful for creating the HTML template system recognizing tags.\nRegexes are widely used for browser detection, form validation, spam filtration, and password strength checking.\nIt is helpful in user input validation testing like email address, mobile number, and IP address.\nIt helps in highlighting the special keywords in file based upon the search result or input.\nMetacharacters allow us to create more complex patterns.\n\nYou can create complex search patterns by applying some basic rules of regular expressions. Many arithmetic operators (+, -, ^) are also used by regular expressions to create complex patterns.\nOperators in Regular Expression\n\n\nOperator\nDescription\n\n\n^\nIt indicates the start of string.\n\n\n$\nIt indicates the end of the string.\n\n\n.\nIt donates any single character.\n\n\n()\nIt shows a group of expressions.\n\n\n[]\nIt finds a range of characters, e.g., [abc] means a, b, or c.\n\n\n[^]\nIt finds the characters which are not in range, e.g., [^xyz] means NOT x, y, or z.\n\n\n-\nIt finds the range between the elements, e.g., [a-z] means a through z.\n\n\n|\nIt is a logical OR operator, which is used between the elements.

The POSIX syntax can be used with Perl-style regular expression function interchangeably. The quantifiers introduced in POSIX section can also be used in PERL style regular expression.\nMetacharacters\nA metacharacter is an alphabetical character followed by a backslash that gives a special meaning to the combination.\nFor example - \'\\d\' metacharacter can be used search large money sums: /([\\d]+)000/. Here /d will search the string of numerical character.\nBelow is the list of metacharacters that can be used in PERL Style Regular Expressions -\n\n\nCharacter\nDescription\n\n\n.\nMatches a single character\n\n\n\\s\nIt matches a whitespace character like space, newline, tab.\n\n\n\\S\nNon-whitespace character\n\n\n\\d\nIt matches any digit from 0 to 9.\n\n\n\\D\nMatches a non-digit character.\n\n\n\\w\nMatches for a word character such as - a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _\n\n\n\\W\nMatches a non-word character.\n\n\n[aeiou]\nIt matches any single character in the given set.\n\n\n[^aeiou]\nIt matches any single character except the given set.\n\n\n(foo|baz|bar)\nMatches any of the alternatives specified.\n\n\nModifiers\nThere are several modifiers available, which makes the work much easier with a regular expression. For example - case-sensitivity or searching in multiple lines, etc.\nBelow is the list of modifiers used in PERL Style Regular Expressions -\n\n\nCharacter\nDescription\n\n\ni\nMakes case insensitive search\n\n\nm\nIt specifies that if a string has a carriage return or newline characters, the $ and ^ operator will match against a newline boundary rather than a string boundary. \n\n\no\nEvaluates the expression only once \n\n\ns\nIt allows the use of .(dot) to match a newline character\n\n\nx\nThis modifier allows us to use whitespace in expression for clarity.\n\n\ng\nIt globally searches all matches.\n\n\ncg\nIt allows the search to continue even after the global match fails.\n\n\nPHP Regexp POSIX Function\nPHP currently provides seven functions to search strings using POSIX-style regular expression -\n\n\nFunction\nDescription\n\n\npreg_match()\nThis function searches the pattern inside the string and returns true if the pattern exists otherwise returns false.\n\n\npreg_match_all()\nThis function matches all the occurrences of pattern in the string.\n\n\npreg_replace()\nThe preg_replace() function is similar to the ereg_replace() function, except that the regular expressions can be used in search and replace.\n\n\npreg_split()\nThis function exactly works like split() function except the condition is that it accepts regular expression as an input parameter for pattern.
